Modular Cloud offers a **free, open source block explorer** that can easily integrate with **any new decentralized protocol**. The backend of this block explorer is powered by our cloudâ€”a platform that allows developers to build applications on top of these protocols.

## Why protocol developers should work with us
*A protocol developer is an individual or organization that is building an L1 blockchain, rollup, or other type of decentralized protocol.*
- We offer a block explorer for your protocol.
- The APIs providing data to our block explorer can be made available to third-party developers in your ecosystem.
- We can automatically connect your protocol to applications built on our cloud, providing a rich ecosystem of compatible apps and tools within seconds.
- The base cost is $0. Charges will only be incurred based on additional services provided.

## Why application developers should work with us
*An application developer is an individual or organization that is using a decentralized protocol. This could be a game, dapp, wallet, dev tool, or even a block explorer.*
- Our block explorer can be customized to fit the needs of your application. Instead of only focusing on the base protocol, our explorer enables rich contextualization at the application level.
