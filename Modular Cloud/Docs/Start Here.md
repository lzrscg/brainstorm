Modular Cloud enables developers to build multi-chain applications with ease. The flagship product powered by Modular Cloud is Explorerâ€”a free and open source block explorer that is easy to integrate with *any protocol*.

In a modular world, it is easy to build new chains, rollups, and decentralized protocols. Since traditional blockchain applications are not built to handle multiple chains, this creates huge opportunities for individuals and teams building for this new paradigm. Modular Cloud gives developers everything they need to take on this emerging market.




## Why protocol developers should work with us
*A protocol developer is an individual or organization that is building an L1 blockchain, rollup, or other type of decentralized protocol.*
- We offer a block explorer for your protocol.
- The APIs providing data to our block explorer can be made available to third-party developers in your ecosystem.
- We can automatically connect your protocol to applications built on our cloud, providing a rich ecosystem of compatible apps and tools within seconds.
- The base cost is $0. Charges will only be incurred based on additional services provided.

## Why application developers should work with us
*An application developer is an individual or organization that is using a decentralized protocol. This could be a game, dapp, wallet, dev tool, or even a block explorer.*
- Our block explorer can be customized to fit the needs of your application. Instead of only focusing on the base protocol, our explorer enables rich contextualization at the application level.
