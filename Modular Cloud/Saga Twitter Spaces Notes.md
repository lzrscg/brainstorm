 My view of the blockchain space in general
- Launching new chains and protocols has never been easier.
- Cosmos gives anyone the tools to build their own blockchain.
- Rollup technology, pioneered by Celestia and the Ethereum community, and Interchain Security, pioneered by Saga and the Cosmos community, allow anyone to share security with existing chains. This removes a major barrier to launching a chain.
- As more chains proliferate, cross-chain and special-purpose protocols will emerge to address multi-chain use cases.
- Ultimately, since the cost of launching a new chain will go down, we will expect thousands of new chains to hit the market. This will spur innovation because it will enable thousands of low-stakes experiments, leading to technological breakthroughs and novel use cases.

My view of Saga
- Saga is leading this charge in two ways: (1) they doing the hard work of actually implementing shared security with their chainlets and main chain (2) they are building enabler technologies that create an incredible developer experience for those interested in launching their own chainlets.
- I have personally launched a chainlet using the Cassiopeia testnet myself, and I can attest that the process is very smooth. Since this is an area I focus on, I particularly appreciate the work they do behind the scenes to automate different aspects of the deployment, such as spinning up an RPC node and Blockscout block explorer.
- I also got a chance to work with hackathon participants. The community of people building on Saga is incredible. Clearly, this has struck a nerve and people like this vision for launching decentralized applications.
- Shout out to Another World, who we partnered with to build a dashboard for rankings in their incredible game.

What Modular Cloud is building
- We are building infrastructure for this multi-protocol future.
- Currently, if you are building a new protocol you need to make a tradeoff between innovation and practicality. The more things you change, the harder it is for people to use your product. For example, if you launch and EVM compatible chain, then you will have access to EVM tools. If you create a new VM, it may be superior, but now you will have no tooling in your ecosystem.
- Modular Cloud solves this by building a framework for building software that maximizes compatibility without sacrificing depth or power.
- Currently, our main product is a free, open source block explorer that is compatible with EVM chains, Cosmos chains, and Solana SVM chains—all in one. Furthermore, adding support for new VMs and protocols is super easy.
- This explorer is powered by our cloud platform. Our cloud-based APIs give third-party developers the ability to access and query indexed data with ease. In the future, we will open up platform level access to third-parties as well, creating an ecosystem of integrations for all indexed chains.
- With this set of features, new chains will now have world-class cloud infrastructure and tooling support on day 1. We want to break down any last remaining barriers preventing innovation in this space. As a developer, you should focus on adding value to your community—not undifferentiated heavy lifting.

How Modular Cloud can work with Saga
- We want to make our block explorer automatically available to all Saga chainlets free of charge.
- This would also include access to our cloud-based APIs for data retrieval. One example use case would be that you could use our indexed data to build an NFT app on your EVM chainlet.
- We intend to build deeper integrations with Saga surrounding ICS, so you can see what is happening on at all layers of your application.
- We want to work specifically with members of the vibrant Saga community to tailor our products to their needs.
- We understand the technology behind Saga, have worked with projects using Saga, and, of course, are talking to Saga directly. So please, reach out if you are in the community and want to work together.
