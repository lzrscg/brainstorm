In all honesty, I'm mostly a frontend devâ€”not a blockchain theorist. I like making apps. And I believe that blockchains can help make apps far better than they are today.

Blockchain theorists should be obsessing over app developers in the same way that Amazon obsesses over customers. Customers want low prices, and app developers want... well... hmmm...

What do they want? Let's dive in.

# Historical background
## Bitcoin
First, there was Bitcoin.

Although Bitcoin *can* be thought of as a technology platform, it launched with a killer app: Electronic cash. It did this one thing really well (below a certain scale). And, in the process, there was one major innovation and one minor optimization that it pioneered.

### Proof-of-Work
Coordination can be easy in small groups, but scales very poorly. By the time you hit a global scale, it is almost impossible to gain consensus on anything.

Proof-of-Work allowed a global network of untrusted participants come to consensus on a *narrow set of facts*. It did this in several ways:
- **It constrained attack vectors** - cryptography gave certain mathematical guarantees. For example, it is impossible to send a transaction without the private key or build a block without mining. *Anything can happen* at a central bank. *Anything is possible* in an application hosted on Amazon Web Services. Bitcoin is **not** 100% secure, but there are only a few possible ways of attacking it.
- **It enabled users to formally model risk** - 

## Ethereum
Next, came Ethereum.
