## Coordination does not scale
Coordinating between two people is hard enough. As the number of participants in any system grows, coordination costs increase exponentially. This is often referred to as Brooks' Law.

*At risk of venturing out of my depth, I like to think of adding people as increasing entropy to the system. The number of microstate configurations leading to "bad" macrostates increases as a percentage of total possible microstates.*

## Consensus is not a good metaphor for blockchains
There is a common narrative that blockchains allow global consensus on data and state. There is a good reason to believe this. After all, a lot of the ideas behind blockchain technology come from [research into consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault). And isn't that what Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake do? Not exactly.

Consensus is a form of coordinationâ€”and coordination cannot not scale globally.
