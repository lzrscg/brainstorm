Take any thing in any amount. If you increase its that thing's quantity, new properties will start to emerge at a macro level.
- An individual person may act according to his or her needs, but the behavior of many people will be governed by the laws of economics.
- Single particles may have random or non-deterministic behaviors, but large objects made of many particles follow simple laws of motion.
- Matrix multiplication turns from a handy math technique to the foundation of intelligence, at scale.
- One cell can't do much, but put many of them together and you have an organism.
- The number of examples are endless.

One more silly example: Imagine you had one or two tomatoes. This could be a tasty snack. However, eventually if you add more tomatoes to the pile you will generate lots of heat, grow colonies of bacteria and other organisms, which could start creating an ecosystem that could power the evolutionary process to create new species of organisms.

# Product Market Fit
Deploying cash does not work at scale. You can solve a problem for one customer, but that does not mean that you know how to solve problems for 100 customers. You may have an idea for how this could work, but the exact steps needed to execute on this vision can be unclear. It is even more difficult to deploy non-cash resources, as they are less liquid and more complex.

Startup people study this concept of "product market fit". Some say "you know it when you have it." Others say you should survey customers to see how much they depend on your productâ€”if many do, then you have it.

These are just estimators for how well you are going to be able to deploy additional capital.
