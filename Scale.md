Take any thing in any amount. If you increase its that thing's quantity, new properties will start to emerge at a macro level.
- An individual person may act according to his or her needs, but the behavior of many people will be governed by the laws of economics.

- Matrix multiplication turns from a handy math technique to the foundation of intelligence, at scale.
- One cell can't do much, but put many of them together and you have an organism.
- The number of examples are endless.

One more silly example: Imagine you had one or two tomatoes. This could be a tasty snack. However, eventually if you add more tomatoes to the pile you will generate lots of heat, grow colonies of bacteria and other organisms, which could start creating an ecosystem that could power the evolutionary process to create new species of organisms.
